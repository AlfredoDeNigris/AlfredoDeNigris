# Hi there! I am Ignacio De Nigris, a Full-Stack Developer dedicated to the maintenance, optimization, and expansion of computer systems.

###During my academic journey, I discovered my passion for the world of programming, which led me to suspend my university career to fully immerse myself in this exciting field.

###My educational path has been mostly self-taught, complemented by some courses that played a fundamental role in my training. Backed by a solid logical-mathematical foundation, I have excelled in application ###development using technologies such as React, SQL, Node.js, and Express.js.
